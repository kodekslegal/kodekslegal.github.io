					<strong>Legal translation</strong> is a delicate work that requires interdisciplinary skills, which range from legal knowledge
					to the application of translation theories and techniques. It also requires the research skills of the comparative-lawyer as well as the editorial skills of the professional editor.

					Thanks to the work of a lawyer-linguist who is qualified both in the legal and translation fields, <strong>Kodeks – Legal Languages offers</strong> a range of <strong>linguistic services for all your legal documents</strong>.

					Each legal system is a web of interrelated concepts, which are created and evolve according to historical,
					social and economic factors. Due to these developments, concepts that are known to one legal system may be unknown to others. 
				</p>
				<p class="columns_bl_col_tx">
					How, therefore, do you find similarities and differences between the jurisdiction of one country and that of another?
				</p>
				<p class="columns_bl_col_tx">
					By resorting to <strong>comparative law</strong>. A competent comparison of two or more legal systems provides correspondences and divergences between them.
					Being aware of this is the most crucial step in the legal translation process.

					Once the legal concepts have been compared, their meaning must then be transferred from one language (or culture) to another.

					In 2012, <strong>Marco Battaglia</strong> received a <strong>Law Degree</strong> from the <strong>University of Trento, Italy</strong> (<em>Laurea Magistrale a ciclo unico</em>, a five-year law degree equivalent to the English LLB and LLM).
					His course of study focused on comparative and international law and was concluded with 
					a research dissertation entitled “The circulation of legal models in the Russian civil codification”. The research, which was funded by the University of Trento, was conducted in Italy, Russia and Finland.
				</p>	
				<p class="columns_bl_col_tx">
					After completing his law degree, he then went on to pursue an <strong>MA in Legal Translation</strong> at <strong>City University London, UK</strong>. His dissertation was
					the translation from English into Italian of the American <em>Uniform Commercial Code Article 9 – Secured Transactions</em>, as enacted by the State of New York.

				<h3 class="it columns_bl_col_h">Translation</h3>
				<p class="columns_bl_col_tx">
					The art (or science) of transferring the content of a written text from a language (or culture) to another. Thanks to the skills of a lawyer-linguist who studied law in Italy
					and legal translation in the United Kingdom, Kodeks – Legal Languages offers translation services for your legal documents <strong>from English into Italian</strong> and <strong>from Italian into English</strong>.
				</p>	
				<h3 class="it columns_bl_col_h">Editing</h3>
				<p class="columns_bl_col_tx">
					Editing and proofreading are often confused with each other or are considered as synonyms. However, in the translation field they are two different types of service.
				</p>
				<p class="columns_bl_col_tx">
					“Editing” a document involves working on both the source text (the text to be translated) and the target text (the translated text) to ensure that the content of the target text conforms to the content of the source text,
					and that the translated text is correctly and coherently drafted.
				</p>
				<p class="columns_bl_col_tx">
					Kodeks – Legal Languages offers editing services for texts translated <strong>from English into Italian</strong>, with the guarantee that your translated documents will accurately reproduce
					the content of the source text and that they will be drafted in an impeccable and natural legal Italian, both in form and style.
				</p>
				<h3 class="it columns_bl_col_h">Proofreading</h3>
				<p class="columns_bl_col_tx">
					“Proofreading” refers to correcting only one text, usually the target text.
				</p>
				<p class="columns_bl_col_tx">
					Kodeks – Legal Languages offers proofreading services for texts <strong>in Italian</strong>, so your texts can be free of any typographical, grammatical and syntactical errors,
					and the document and content can be correct, coherent and well formatted. We can also guarantee that the language and style of your texts will be natural and appropriate to the topic and genre of your documents.
				</p>
				<h3 class="it columns_bl_col_h">Document Review</h3>
				<p class="columns_bl_col_tx">
					Sometimes time goes by so quickly, whereas the pile of documents in front of you or the files that you should examine show no sign of decreasing. 
					“Document review” entails reading and evaluating substantial amounts of texts, articles or legal documents in a short time. This is done with the aim of locating and identifying
					how much of their content is relevant to your research or business.
				</p>
				<p class="columns_bl_col_tx">
					Kodeks – Legal Languages offers document review services for texts, judgments, articles or legal documents of any kind <strong>in English and Italian</strong>, so that you may redirect your time, money and 
					efforts to other activities.
